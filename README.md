## What does this program do?
TransliteratorCE is a program to transliterate text on your calculator. This means that this program can display text you give, in another alphabet/writing system!
You want to display something in Runes? This program makes that possible on your calculator!

## How does it work?
Actually, it is very simple and basic. The program just displays the text you wrote. It does not do anything special. It just shows it in another font, which makes your text being displayed in another alphabet. So it is just using alphabet fonts. I created all these fonts myself.

## How do I use this program?
First, you should send the program to your calculator. Packed with the program are some *.8xv files. These files are the font files. You need to transfer the fonts you want to be able to transliterate to, to your calculator.
If you have it all on your calculator, you can just run the program and start transliterating!

## Sending to your calculator and running the program.
You can easily send the program to your calculator using TiLP or TI-connect CE.
Once you've sent it to your calculator there are two possible options to run the program:
* If the OS of your calculator is 5.5 or higher, then you should run the program via Cesium, or use asmhook.
* If the OS of your calculator is 5.4 or below, you can just run the program via the [prgm] menu.

### Note:
To be able to run this program, you also need the C-libraries installed.
You can find them at: https://tiny.cc/clibs

## Supported alphabets:
* Elder Futhark (Runes), FUTHARK.8xv
* Nyctograph, NYCTO.8xv
* Ogham, OGHAM.8xv
* Phoenician, PHOENIC.8xv
* Proto-Sinaitic, SINAITIC.8xv

## Thanks to:
I really want to thank my friend Simon, for he was the person to get me into alphabets again.
Further thanks to Commandblockguy for helping with the 'th' function, though later I did it in a bit different way.
And thanks to RoccoLox Programs for testing this program before release.
